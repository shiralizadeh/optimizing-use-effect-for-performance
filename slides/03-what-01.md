# What is it?

- `useEffect(callback, deps?)` is a Swiss Army knife
- A hook that runs a **callback** under conditions
  - Once React **mounts** the component
  - Detect **changes** in dependencies
  - On **each** render
- It lets you perform side effects <br />
  (fetch data, timers, javascript stuff, & more)
